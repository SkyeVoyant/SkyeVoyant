# 🌌 Hey there, I’m SkyeVoyant

I’m a self-taught **web designer & backend developer** who loves JavaScript and absolutely despises Python 🐍💀  
I build fast, efficient systems powered by **React** and **Node.js**, always trying to squeeze every drop of performance out of my setup.

---

### 💻 What I Work With
**Languages:** JavaScript  
**Frameworks & Tools:** React, Node.js (Express), Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Docker, K3s, WebSockets  
**Other Interests:** UI/UX design, Discord.js bots, self-hosting, automation, and over-engineering everything

---

**My JS toolkit**
- **Realtime & messaging:** socket.io, ws, kafkajs  
- **Auth & security:** passport, express-session (+ connect-pg-simple), argon2, jsonwebtoken, express-rate-limit  
- **Data & validation:** pg, zod / ajv (+ ajv-formats)  
- **APIs & IO:** axios, node-fetch, chokidar, tar-stream  
- **Integrations:** googleapis, discord.js  
- **Media & UX:** hls.js, xterm (+ fit/web-links)  
- **Dev & ops:** dockerode, cors, morgan, cookie-parser, dotenv, vite

### 🎨 About Me
I like making my systems ridiculously overkill for fun 😅  
From running a full **K3s + Flux** setup for flawless zero-downtime updates, to wiring **Redis** and **Kafka** where they aren’t fully needed. If it can be automated, optimized, or made unnecessarily complex, I’ll do it.  
Everything lives in **Postgres**, even when a few JSON files would’ve worked just fine.

### 🧩 Open-Source Projects
Most of my public work is just small tools I built to make my life easier while coding — but if they help someone else too, that’s even better!
